This mini project models a basic IT Service Management scenario, focusing on incident resolution times by priority level. Using Python and libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, the script reads incident data from an Excel spreadsheet, converts timestamps, calculates response times in hours, and groups the results by priority. A bar chart is then generated to visually present the average response time for High, Medium, and Low priority incidents. The analysis reveals that High-priority incidents are resolved the fastest, while Low-priority incidents experience longer resolution times. This simple analysis demonstrates both the importance of prioritizing critical issues and the ability to extract and communicate insights from operational data, relevant skills for IT service and data analytics roles.
